To achieve **data restriction outside the office but allow it inside the office** with the **lowest budget**, let's break it down into **essential requirements** and the **cheapest possible solution**.  

---

### **✅ Key Requirements (Must Be Achieved)**
1️⃣ **Block sending data (file transfers, emails, uploads) when connected from home.**  
2️⃣ **Allow normal data transfers when inside the office network.**  
3️⃣ **Apply restrictions to only company-owned devices.**  
4️⃣ **Use the cheapest licensing option while maintaining security.**  

---

## **🔎 Step-by-Step Cheapest Solution**
💰 **Target License:** **Microsoft 365 Business Premium** (₹1,975/user/month)  
- 🎯 **Why?** Includes **Intune, Conditional Access, and Defender for Business**, at a lower cost than Microsoft 365 E3/E5!  
- ❌ **Limitations:** No **full Endpoint DLP**, but we can bypass this using **Intune + Conditional Access + Firewall Rules.**  

---

### **🔷 Step 1: Restrict Access to Microsoft 365 Services Outside the Office**
📌 **Purpose:** Block access to OneDrive, SharePoint, Outlook, and Teams when outside the corporate network.  

✅ **Create a Conditional Access Policy in Entra ID (Azure AD)**  
1️⃣ **Go to** Entra ID (Azure AD) → Security → Conditional Access → New Policy.  
2️⃣ **Apply to:**  
   - **Users:** All company-owned devices  
   - **Apps:** Select Microsoft 365 apps (**Exchange Online, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, etc.**)  
3️⃣ **Condition: IP Location → Allow access only from corporate IP range.**  
4️⃣ **Access Control:**  
   - Block access when connected from outside (home/public networks).  
5️⃣ **Save & Apply!**  

✅ **Effect:**  
- **Inside Office:** Employees can access Microsoft 365 normally. ✅  
- **Outside Office:** Microsoft 365 apps (OneDrive, SharePoint, Outlook) are blocked. 🚫

### **🔷 Step 2: Block USB File Transfers Using Intune**
📌 **Purpose:** Prevent users from copying files to USB devices at home.  

✅ **Configure an Intune Device Restriction Policy**  
1️⃣ **Go to** Intune Admin Center → Devices → Configuration Profiles.  
2️⃣ **Create a new policy:** Windows 10/11 → Device Restrictions.  
3️⃣ **Set Restrictions:**  
   - **Block USB Storage** ✅  
   - **Block Copy-Paste to Unmanaged Apps** ✅  
4️⃣ **Assign policy to all company-owned devices.**  
5️⃣ **Save & Deploy!**  

✅ **Effect:**  
- Users **cannot copy files to USB drives**, preventing offline data leaks. 🚫  

---

### **🔷 Step 3: Block External Cloud Storage & File Transfers Using Windows Defender**
📌 **Purpose:** Prevent users from uploading files to Google Drive, Dropbox, and other cloud storage outside the office.  

✅ **Configure Microsoft Defender for Business (Included in M365 Business Premium)**  
1️⃣ **Go to** Microsoft Defender Admin Center → Policies → Web Content Filtering.  
2️⃣ **Create a new policy to block:**  
   - **Google Drive, Dropbox, WeTransfer, Box, Mega.nz, etc.**  
3️⃣ **Assign to all company-owned devices.**  
4️⃣ **Save & Deploy!**  

✅ **Effect:**  
- Users **cannot upload files to cloud storage** when outside the office. 🚫  

---

### **🔷 Step 4: Use Sophos Firewall to Enforce Home Network Blocking (Extra Security)**
📌 **Purpose:** Ensure that even if users try to bypass **Conditional Access**, their devices remain restricted.  

✅ **Use Sophos Firewall to Enforce Traffic Rules:**  
1️⃣ **Create a Web Filter Rule in Sophos Firewall:**  
   - Inside Office: ✅ **Allow all traffic**  
   - Outside Office (home networks): 🚫 **Block external file transfers**  
   - **Block personal email services (Gmail, Yahoo Mail, etc.).**  
2️⃣ **Assign the firewall rule to all company devices.**  
3️⃣ **Apply Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) to detect file uploads.**  
4️⃣ **Enable logging & alerts for any policy violation.**  

✅ **Effect:**  
- **Inside Office:** Normal internet access allowed. ✅  
- **Outside Office:** No file uploads, no personal email access, and no cloud storage access. 🚫

## **🎯 Final Cost-Effective Solution Outcome**
| **Feature**               | **Solution Used** | **Cost** |
|--------------------------|----------------|---------|
| **Microsoft 365 Apps Restriction** | Entra ID Conditional Access | ✅ Included in M365 Business Premium (₹1,975/user) |
| **USB File Transfer Blocking** | Intune Device Restriction | ✅ Included in M365 Business Premium |
| **Cloud Storage Upload Blocking** | Microsoft Defender Web Filtering | ✅ Included in M365 Business Premium |
| **Extra Security (Home Network Restriction)** | Sophos Firewall Rules | ✅ No extra cost (already in use) |

---

### **🎯 Key Benefits of This Budget-Friendly Approach**
✅ **Cheaper than Microsoft 365 E3/E5 (Only ₹1,975/user)**  
✅ **No need for expensive Microsoft Purview DLP add-ons.**  
✅ **Blocks all key data exfiltration methods.**  
✅ **Uses existing Sophos Firewall to enhance security.**  
✅ **Applies only to company-owned devices, avoiding user complaints.**
